# 42-get_next_line  
### Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious.  
  
This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.  
Everytime the function is called, it returns the following line from a file. The bonus files make the function able to read from multiple files, instead of only one.
